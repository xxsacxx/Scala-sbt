0- Create the file ~/.sbt/1.0/plugins/plugins.sbt with addSbtPlugin("org.ensime" % "sbt-ensime" % "2.5.1") to download ensime 
1- follow the directory architecture as per sbt i.e file.scala should be in base_dir/src/main/scala
2- create the sbt in the directory where build.sbt is present 
3- After making any changes in build.sbt , reload in sbt and then run ensimeConfig to generate the .ensime
4- Once .ensime is generated , then import the base_dir in your text editor to edit file.scala
5- run ensime-start in editor ,now your sbt is acting as build tool along with ensime as another tool which will help you monitor errors and click in to fns,

There are many other things which I did to get this running, but my brain is terribly tired to remember them, once it will be active enough will add more points
